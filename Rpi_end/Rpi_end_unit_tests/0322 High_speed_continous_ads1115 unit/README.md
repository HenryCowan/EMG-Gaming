High speed continous driver of ads1115

To control the ads1115 to read at >400hz, the ads driver should control ads1115 in continous mode
However, there is no existed ads1115 continous lib in C++ found so I write this QT/C++ one 
no need to write config every time before every reading, thus time interval can go beneath 2ms

modification to previous intro
        There is no ads1115 continuous mode library in c++, but there is another python lib
        And another C code is found which is not yet object oriented but a demo and also continuous mode
